## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, plotly, tensorflow

### Installation

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly tensorflow
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Visualization

The project includes visualizations using Plotly to explore the data, including gender distribution, marital status distribution, self-employment distribution, applicant income distribution, and more.

### Outlier Removal

Outliers in the 'ApplicantIncome' and 'CoapplicantIncome' columns have been removed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

## Machine Learning Models

### Random Forest Classifier

A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the preprocessed data for loan approval prediction.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is implemented and evaluated for loan approval prediction.

## Results

### Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using classification reports, confusion matrices, and accuracy scores.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of predicting loan approval status using machine learning. Further improvements and optimizations can be explored.
